# Week 36

## Monday and Tuesday

Done with the setup for the rest_api_startcode, which u can see here: https://github.com/cwulfftorn/rest-jpa-devops-startcode. 

I have also pushed the project to my domain name: http://cwulfftorn.com/rest-jpa-devops-starter/api/xxx

Done with the setup for the Movie project, which u can find here: https://github.com/cwulfftorn/Movie. 
The project is not running properly, so i haven't tested the project. Because of that i haven't had the time to fix it cause i wanted to start with the rest of the exercises for this week.

## Wednesday

Both exercises are done. The JavaScript Day-1 exercise is a bit huddled to read, my apoligies. Couldnt really figure out, how to organize the excersises, But everything should be there.

## Thursday

The first exercise Dom Manipulation and Events is roughly done, im missing the calculator part of the exercise.
Ran out of time so the last exercise has not been made.
