# Week 36

## Monday and Tuesday

Done with the setup for the rest_api_startcode, which u can see here: https://github.com/cwulfftorn/rest-jpa-devops-startcode.

Done with the setup for the Movie project, which u can find under Monday and Tuesday called exercise2. All tho the project is not running properly, so i haven't tested the project. Because of that i haven't had the time to fix it cause i wanted to start with the rest of the exercises for this week.

## Wednesday

Both exercises are done. The JavaScript Day-1 exercise is a bit huddled to read, my apoligies. Couldnt really figure out, how to organize the excersises. Everything should be there.

## Thursday

The first exercise Dom Manipulation and Events is roughly done, im missing the calculator part of the exercise.
